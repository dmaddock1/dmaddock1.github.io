## Abstract

Scholars of the Old English poem _Andreas_ have long debated its dating and authorship, as the poem shares affinities both with _Beowulf_ and the signed poems of Cynewulf. Although this debate hinges on poetic style and other internal evidence, the stylistic uniformity of _Andreas_ has not been suitably demonstrated. This paper investigates this question by examining the distribution of oral-formulaic data within the poem, which is then correlated to word frequency and orthographic profiles generated with lexomic techniques. The analysis identifies an earlier version of the poem, which has been expanded by a later poet.
