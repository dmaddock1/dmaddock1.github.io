I didn't realize it fully at the time, but the reader in the second half of this book is top-notch. Of course, Zamenhof's few original poems are there, but you also get readings from his letters about creating the language, and a short biographical piece. There are running serials of correspondence and travel logs which is decent reading. Among the last of the selections are [William Auld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Auld)'s poem _Ebrio_ and excerpts  from [Baghy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Baghy)'s _Sur Sanga Tero_ and [Tibor Sekelj](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibor_Sekelj)'s book about his travels in the Amazon--all of which were originally composed in Esperanto.

My two textbook recommendations for new learners would be this book and the now out-of-print 3rd edition of _Teach Yourself Esperanto_. From these you can go straight into real Esperanto literature.
