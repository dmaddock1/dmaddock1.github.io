A common idea in Christianity is that it is superior to Judaism because christians are "not under law but under grace."  That is, the Judaic law was oppressive and impossible to follow.  Jesus rescued us from such dogmatic oppression.

This view is a bunch of crap.  The fact is that the vast majority of rules were not hard to keep--keep a diet, take one day off a week, etc.  However, Christian doctrine is more oppressive in my view because it does not simply seek to regulate behavior, rather, it requires regulation of the internal state of the person.  If you thought it was impossible to follow the Judaic law (or even the more restrictive pharisaic interpretations), try controlling your thoughts and feelings.
