Not used to sleeping alone.<br/>
It gets so hard to close my eyes in the dark.<br/>
When I know your gone...<br/>
I feel your pillow next to me<br/>
Try to believe it's you enough to dream.

Every morning I wake up alone.<br/>
I try instead to pull myself out of bed.<br/>
When I know your gone...<br/>
The distance between you and me<br/>
grows far beyond a point that I can see.

Not used to being alone.<br/>
You look the same, but there's dust on the frame<br/>
Since you've been gone.<br/>
Our wedding photos on the wall<br/>
Are memories too painful to recall.
