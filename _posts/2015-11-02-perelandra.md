You know how _Atlas Shrugged_ is basically an excuse to write the long-ass philosophical speeches by d'Anconia and Galt? That's rather the case here. I think Lewis does a good job of imagining how the temptation of Eve might've actually gone down if, you know, it had actually ever happened, which it did not.

A friend of mine considers the Space Trilogy in the tradition of Verne/Wells-style sci-fi and I think he is certainly right. Still, I feel vaguely uneasy about using the word 'science' to describe them because they are based so fundamentally on Lewis' religion as to be almost un-science-fiction.
