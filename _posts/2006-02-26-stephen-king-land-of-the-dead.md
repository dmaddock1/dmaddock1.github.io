In Stephen King's _Entertainment Weekly_ column, The Pop of King, he [discusses _Land of the Dead_](https://ew.com/article/2007/02/01/stephen-king-dead-quartet/).

Word up, Steve!

What I love best about Romero's _Dead_ films (yes, they are films, not movies) is the realism of the storylines (once you accept the initial assumption that the dead can come back, of course). The movies are character-driven, not brainless run-for-your-life crap as the horror genre is so often pigeonholed. The plots are compelling and not simply excuses to spill blood.

Also, Romero makes almost no attempt to explain what has caused this phenomenon, which I love because it is not important. The characters have more pressing matters to think about than why.

The over-explanation mistake is made so frequently in movies. Take _Independence Day_: remember the scene when the president reads the mind of the captive alien through it's telepathic ability and learns their ultimate plan for Earth? This cheapened the movie a lot. For starters, as a viewer I have already accepted the fact that aliens have attacked Earth, why must I need a reason? Will having one make the alien invasion seem more realistic? No. Instead, I now have to believe in aliens and their conveniently pointless telepathic abilities.

In short, if you're not down with the _Dead_ and don't consider yourself squimish, you have an obligation to yourself to watch them--as if you were watching films, not a movies.
