Can I tread water a little longer<br/>
Holding these things above my head?<br/>
I can drift 'til the tide gets stronger<br/>
And let it pull me back to land.<br/>
So, I'll just kick my feet.

I can feel the warm salt water<br/>
As it dries upon my face.<br/>
Crystalizing, compromising.<br/>
How do they justify this place?<br/>
How?

_Fly, Robin, fly.<br/>
Yours is the sky<br/>
But you must take it,<br/>
No one else can claim it for you._

You say you long to scale a mountain<br/>
But the peak can seem so far.<br/>
Turn around see where you come from.<br/>
The air is getting thin right where you are.<br/>
Have you looked behind?

What can I say so you believe me?<br/>
What do I do to make you see?<br/>
The more you carry the slower the climb<br/>
So drop those stones and make it in half the time.

_Fly, Robin, fly.<br/>
Yours is the sky<br/>
But you must take it,<br/>
No one else can claim it but you._
