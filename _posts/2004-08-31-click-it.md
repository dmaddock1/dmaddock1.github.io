Yesterday I got the stupidest computer question ever in my career in information technology. The conversation went something like this:

> _Tool_: Hi Dave, I can't find [some resource] on the intranet, can you tell me how to access it?
> 
> _Me_: I'll send you an email with a link to it.
> 
> _Tool_:(considering pause) So what am I supposed to do, like, click it?
> 
> _Me_:(exasperated pause) Yes. You click it.

Can someone tell me what other options you can possibly have with a modern computer? Stare at it, use the Force on it, print it out and make a pirate hat from it?
