> How can I make my future engineering education more well rounded, with regards to the liberal arts?

Why should it be? An engineering education should teach you engineering. The whole point of primary and secondary school is to lay down a liberal arts base that you can build on yourself for the rest of your life. You can take it from here. If a future humanities major asked me how to make their education more scientifically well rounded, I’d give them the same advice. (Consider yourself lucky. It is harder to self-study university-level science or math than it is literature, philosophy, or history, although it is certainly possible.) The roundedness of your education is your own personal responsibility and depends on how much you polish the edges on your own time.

Check out the book “How to Read a Book,” by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren. It is a handy guide to doing this. It has an appendix with a decent reading list. Pick something and start reading.
