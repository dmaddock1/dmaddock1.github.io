I read from Äˆapitro XIX of _La Hobito_ (the Esperanto translation of _The Hobbit_) for the languages segment of the upcoming Mythgard Institute Webathon on Sept. 22, 2013. Tune in to the live stream on the 22nd (link below) for 12 hours of Tolkien and fantasy literature goodness from the students of the Mythgard Institute and Signum University.
