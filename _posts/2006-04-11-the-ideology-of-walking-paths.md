I had an interesting conversation with some friends from my statistics class.  CCSU campus had a large circular garden area in the middle of the courtyard which annoyingly hinders direct traffic between the student center and most of the buildings.  It has a meandering path through it, but I generally walk straight across it, ignoring the path.  When they questioned me about it I said that it is designed to assert dominance over the students by subconsciously modifying their behavior.  In other words, the courtyard is a symbol of administration's power over the student.  For this reason, I ignore the path.  Dan then quipped that I should then walk instead on the highest part of the garden, but I rebuffed him on the grounds that doing so would take me out of my way and I prefer to put utility above social commentary.  In fact, the utility is my social commentary.
